description: codebase-pattern-finder is a useful agent for finding similar implementations, usage examples, or existing patterns that can be modeled after. It will give you concrete code examples based on what you're looking for! It's sorta like codebase-locator, but it will not only tell you the location of files, it will also give you code details!

## Harness Tools

Load a skill with `skill({ id: '<name>' })`. Run commands with `shell`. Discover files with `grep`, `glob`, and directory `read`. Fetch pages with `webfetch` and search the web with `websearch`. Spawn subagents with `subagent` (a short `description` is required) and resume them with their `sessionID`. This agent's permissions may restrict a subset of these.

Read .workbench/workflow/agents/codebase-pattern-finder.body.md and follow it.
